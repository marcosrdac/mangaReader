mangaReader
===========

Hello, everyone! It's my first big project... Not that big for real, but for me it is! Here I'm trying to make a software to read mangas from the higher number of sites I know and that is compatible with Android, Linux and Windows, for a while.

I'm alone for now and I think i only have this month to produce the software (because it's my vacation period XD), but I really would love to have someone to code with. I am still learning English, so forgive me for my language mistakes, please! :X

I'm completely open minded for sugestions and any kind of changes to this project. If you wanto to code here too, talk to me!
